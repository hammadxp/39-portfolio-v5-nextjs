I usually follow the MVP roadmap (Minimum Viable Product):

1. Add feature 2. Get feedback 3. Improvise 4. Publish

- For the front-end, I go with React (NextJS), along with Tailwind for styling the UI and Shadcn UI for utilizing ready made components.
- For the backend, I use NextJS server actions, APIs can also be built easily with NextJS.
- For database, I prefer to use MongoDB Atlas (if you need an SQL database, we could go with Supabase) (costs separately)\*
- Mongoose or Prisma can help us in communicating with our database and designing the database schemas
- User authentication can be handled by NextAuth or Clerk (for protected routes like dashboards or profile editing)
- Emails can be handled by Resend or Mailgun (costs separately)\*
- Stripe can help us in managing payments

and that's usually the tech-stack of a full-stack project!
