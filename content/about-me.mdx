#### A little history ✨

My name is Hammad Javed, I am a 24 year old Web Developer from Faisalabad, Pakistan. I have completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from NCBA&E university, Lahore 🎓.

Before getting into web development, I used to be a tech savvy person, tinkering with my devices to make them work as I wanted them to, rooting them, jailbreaking them and automating them. I was in the habit of writing small, Python based CLI apps/scripts, automate stuff with Tasker, AutoHotKey and so on.

That made me realize that programming was natural to me 👨‍💻, I should try to persue my career in it, so I did!

#### My web development journey 🌈

In 2022, I stepped into the world of web development after finishing my Bachelors in Computer Science. I hadn't touched any web stuff during those 4 years of study, but I used to hear about it from other colleages. It **felt interesting** 💫 to me and I couldn't wait to try it out.

So finally the day came, **09 March 2022**, when I wrote my first **"Hello World"** in HTML 😅. I took 2 bootcamp courses from [Jonas Schemdtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) over on Udemy and I'm ever so grateful for them. Jonas' way of teaching was amazing and I highly recommend Him to everyone. It was just the beginning of course and I kept exploring more.

> What all that means is that I became a self-taught web developer, degree in CS barely made a difference for me.

So I continued, at first I thought of going with just the Frontend, but soon I realised I was capable of more 😤, I was fluent with programming, I could give clients a full product from front to back, so I went with the Full-stack route.

I first learned **React**, then the **MERN** stack and then **NextJS** started getting noticed by everyone, so I tried it out and immediately I also fell in love with it 😍. NextJS provided a lot of neat features like file based routing, lazy loading content, SSR / SSG, image optimizations and much more, basically taking a little burden off of us developers.

#### Active in the community 🔥

I keep up-to-date with the ever so expanding world of web development. I'm active on Twitter/X, Discord and other newsletters, though I rarely post myself 😅.

#### Beside web development ⚡

If I'm not on React, I spend some time with Python. Just some basic scripts you know. I have built a Spotify script called Unify to locally save and sync my Spotify playlists, it might get taken down 🤫.

#### Soft skills ⭐

I'm a natural mentor as well, I help my friends all the time, trying to give them a roadmap or heads-up for something they wanna accomplish, whether it's regarding coding or their careers.

#### My education 👨‍🎓

I am a graduate of Computer Science:

- Intermediate of Computer Science (Superior College, Faisalabad)\
