I usually follow these rules:

- Writing clean, type-safe and standardized code along with modularity and organization of files are my top priorities
- I utilize a lot of popular libraries to make the development quicker and efficient (you don't wanna be reinventing the wheel in each new project)
- Re-using code snippets from my previous projects further minimizes the development time
